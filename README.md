# UFOs
Using JavaScript to view UFO sightings

# Overview
The purpose of this project was to use JavaScript to organize and extract information from various locations.  The website createdpopulates an interactive platform for the client to be able to filter by date, location and number of sitings of UFOs.

# Results 
Using JavaScript, I was able to create a websites, were the client can enter the date, city, state, country and shape of the UFO.  Once the results are populated they will view a list of sitings near their indicated city as well as how long the UFO was sited and any comments about the reporting of the siting. 

# Drawbacks and Recommendations
One of the drawbacks is that cities can only be spelled with the first letter in upper case, with correct spacing and spelling. Adding a filter that would allow for upper and lower case spellings of cities would be beneficial.
